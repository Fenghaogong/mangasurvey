= Quick Look Inspection of MaNGA Reductions =

manga_quicklook is designed to allow inspection of spectra from individual fibers based on either SOS or full-pipeline reductions.  The program is located on the as3 svn at manga/mangadrp/branches/testrun/pro/vis/manga_quicklook.pro

----

= Basic installation of the MaNGA SVN code:=

  1) Get set up with an SVN account as per https://howdy.physics.nyu.edu/projects/as3/wiki/Software/SVNTutorial

  2) IDL and the IDL astronomy user's library (http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
     must both be installed on your machine.
     Program has been tested using IDL 7.0.4 on a 64-bit Darwin Mac

  3) Set the environment variables MANGACORE_DIR and MANGADRP_DIR in your .cshrc (or equivalent) file
     to point to where your svn respositories will be installed.
     The IDL code frequently looks for reference files at specific
     places in these directory trees, and these variables tell it how to get
     there.  Also set the variables MANGACORE_VER and MANGADRP_VER to the testrun branch.
     This controls versioning
     of the MaNGA software for later reference, ensuring during deployment phase
     that you always run the same version of software unless deliberately updating.
     For me, I use the lines:
     setenv MANGACORE_DIR /manga/mangacore
     setenv MANGACORE_VER branches/testrun
     setenv MANGADRP_DIR /manga/mangadrp
     setenv MANGADRP_VER branches/testrun

  4) Obtain the latest copy of products from the svn repository.
     You will need the products
         as3svn@howdy.physics.nyu.edu/manga/mangadrp/branches/testrun
         as3svn@howdy.physics.nyu.edu/manga/mangacore/branches/testrun

     Check these out using the commands (note detailed paths DO matter):
     cd to wherever you plan to install the svn products
     svn co svn+ssh://as3svn@howdy.physics.nyu.edu/manga/mangadrp/branches/testrun mangadrp/branches/testrun
     svn co svn+ssh://as3svn@howdy.physics.nyu.edu/manga/mangacore/branches/testrun mangacore/branches/testrun

     You will also need the idlutils products from the SDSS3 SVN
     This can be obtained publicly by
         svn co http://www.sdss3.org/svn/repo/idlutils/trunk/ idlutils

  5) In your .cshrc file (or the equivalent) add the manga directory tree to
     your IDL path.  IDL should be capable of descending into subdirectories
     when compiling code.  This should use the environment variables set above.
     For instance, I use
     setenv IDL_PATH ${IDL_PATH}:+$MANGADRP_DIR/$MANGADRP_VER/
     Make sure that idlutils in on your IDL path as well.

-------

= Starting manga_quicklook =

Start IDL in any directory and type manga_quicklook

It will open a dialog window to select the input spectrum file.  This should either be the SOS file starting with 'sci-' or the full pipeline file starting with 'spFrame'.
In order to function properly, this code relies upon finding appropriate bundle maps describing the locations of individual fibers within bundles, and finding the slitmap describing what is plugged where along the slit and where it maps to on the plate.  The paths to the former is specified relative to MANGACORE_DIR, the code searches for the latter in the reduced data directory.

------

= Running manga_quicklook =

An example of it running is in manga_quicklook.png below.  The idea is that while we're on the mountain (or afterwards, if we want to explore the reduced data) we can point and click on different kinds of fibers over the plate and see what their spectra look like.  If you click on an IFU, it pulls up a map of the IFU to select a fiber from.  The spectrum itself can be zoomed, rescaled, standard stuff (? gives interface commands):
Display Commands
     left click : Set x range
    right click : Set y range
   center click : Set x and y ranges
              [ : Pan left
              ] : Pan right
              p : Pan to the cursor position
              i : Zoom in
              o : Zoom out
              w : Display whole order
            0-9 : Bin spectrum
              h : Plot in histogram mode (toggle)
              s : Print cursor wavelength

Blue spectra are shown by default, red spectra can be toggled using the button in the main window.
