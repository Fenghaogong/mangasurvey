This directory contains the code for the MaNGA data simulator.
There are a variety of flavors:

2d: Image simulator (manga_simimage.pro)
    This program simulates observation of a simple 2d image
    Purpose is to understand the effect of various observing strategies
    on image quality.  This does not account for any noise sources.

3d: Data cube simulator (manga_simcube.pro)
    This program simulates observation of a 3d data cube
    Input is a flux calibrated data cube with a corresponding wavelength
    vector, output is a flux calibrated 'as observed' data cube in a given
    wavelength range mimicing what would be produced by the MaNGA pipeline.

calib: Calibration files for BOSS detector characteristics

ccd: CCD-level data simulator
    Produces mock ccd images from a set of input spectra
